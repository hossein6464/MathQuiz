# MathQuiz
Project School Android 1

Developed an app called Math Quiz app as part of the Final Project for Android 1. 
Math Quiz is a simple app designed for children aged 1 to 14 but adults also can enjoy it. The initial page of the app asks users to choose between 4 options (Kids, Adult, advanced, Genius). Based on the option chosen the user will be directed to the main page where he/she has to guess math questions. Implemented a Score object model to track users' scores.

Used FindViewById instead of  Data Binding and ListView instead of RecyclerView to show the results.
Implemented  Score Model to keep track of Scores
ListViewActivity to show the List of Scores
Main Activity For the Actual Game
